## get_session_history
```python
```python
def get_session_history(session_id):
  """Retrieves the history of actions for a given session.

  This function fetches and returns a list of events that occurred within a specific session. 

  Args:
    session_id: (str) A unique identifier for the session.

  Returns:
    (list) A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an event 
          in the session history. Each event dictionary should contain at least
          the following keys: 
          * 'timestamp': (datetime) The time at which the event occurred.
          * 'event_type': (str) The type of event (e.g., 'page_view', 'search', 'click').
          * 'data': (dict) Any additional data associated with the event.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the provided `session_id` is invalid or not found.

  Examples:
    ```python
    # Example usage:
    session_history = get_session_history("abc123def456")
    print(session_history)  # Output: A list of session events

    # Example event structure:
    [
      {
        'timestamp': datetime(2023, 10, 26, 10, 30, 0),
        'event_type': 'page_view',
        'data': {'page_url': 'https://www.example.com/home'}
      },
      {
        'timestamp': datetime(2023, 10, 26, 10, 32, 0),
        'event_type': 'search',
        'data': {'query': 'python tutorials'}
      }
    ]

**Explanation:**

* **Docstring Structure:** The docstring follows a standard structure:
    * **Function Name:** Clearly states the function's name.
    * **Description:** Provides a concise summary of what the function does.
    * **Arguments:**  Details each input parameter, including its name, type, and purpose.
    * **Returns:** Describes the type and content of the value returned by the function.
    * **Raises:** Lists any exceptions the function might raise and the conditions under which they occur.
    * **Examples:** Demonstrates how to use the function with concrete code snippets and expected outputs.

* **Clarity and Readability:**
    *  The docstring uses plain language and avoids technical jargon wherever possible.
    *  It breaks down information into logical sections using headings and bullet points for easy readability.
    *  Line breaks and indentation enhance the visual structure.

* **Specificity:**

    *  The docstring explicitly mentions the format of the returned event dictionaries, including the expected keys and data types.
    *  It provides a sample event structure to illustrate the expected output.



* **Usage Examples:**  The examples are well-formatted and demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the results.

By providing comprehensive and clear documentation, you make your function more understandable and usable for others (and for your future self!).

## generate_response
```python
```python
def generate_response(question, llm):
  """Generates a response to a given question using a pre-trained language model.

  This function takes a question as input and utilizes a provided language model (`llm`) to generate a comprehensive and informative response. 

  Args:
      question (str): The question to be answered.
      llm (object): A pre-trained language model object capable of text generation.

  Returns:
      str: The generated response from the language model.

  Examples:
      ```python
      # Assuming 'llm' is an instance of a language model like OpenAI's GPT-3
      response = generate_response("What is the capital of France?", llm)
      print(response)  # Output: Paris

      # Example with a more complex question
      response = generate_response("Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.", llm)
      print(response)  # Output: (A detailed explanation of quantum entanglement)
      ```

  """
  # Implementation of response generation logic using the provided 'llm'
  # ...
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Clear Docstring:** The docstring clearly explains the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and provides usage examples.
* **Descriptive Language:**  The docstring uses precise language to describe what the function does and how it works. 
* **Argument and Return Value Descriptions:** It specifies the expected data types for both the `question` argument and the returned `response`.
* **Examples:** The examples demonstrate how to call the function with different types of questions and illustrate the expected output format.

## response_generator
```python
```python
def response_generator(prompt, llm):
  """
  Generates a response from a large language model (LLM) given a prompt.

  This function takes a prompt as input and uses the provided LLM to generate a 
  response. It is designed to be a flexible wrapper for interacting with different 
  LLM APIs or libraries.

  Args:
      prompt (str): The input prompt to be sent to the LLM.
      llm (object): An object representing the LLM, which should have a `generate` 
      method that accepts a prompt and returns a generated response.

  Returns:
      str: The generated response from the LLM.

  Examples:
      >>> from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

      >>> # Load a pre-trained LLM model and tokenizer
      >>> model_name = "t5-small"
      >>> llm_model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
      >>> llm_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

      >>> # Define a prompt
      >>> prompt = "Translate the following sentence into Spanish: Hello, world!"

      >>> # Generate a response using the LLM
      >>> response = response_generator(prompt, llm_model)

      >>> # Print the response
      >>> print(response)
      
      >>> # Example using a hypothetical LLM library
      >>> from my_llm_library import MyLLM

      >>> # Initialize an instance of the LLM
      >>> my_llm = MyLLM()

      >>> # Generate a response
      >>> response = response_generator(prompt, my_llm)

      >>> # Print the response
      >>> print(response)
  """
  return llm.generate(prompt) 
```

**Explanation:**
